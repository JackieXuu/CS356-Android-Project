CRITICAL PROCESS TO RUN PROGRAM:
	- Environment Installation
		- Install SDK
		- Setup AVD
		- Setup NDK
		- Compile a new kernel
		- Configure environment variable

	- Code Changed
		We should define struct prinfo in ~/kernel/goldfish/include/linux/prinfo.h
		This structure is defined as follows:
		struct prinfo {
			long state;					/* current state of process */
			pid_t pid;					/* process id */
			pid_t parent_pid;			/* process id of parent */
			pid_t first_child_pid;  	/* pid of youngest child */
			pid_t next_sibling_pid;  	/* pid of older sibling */
			long uid;					/* user id of process owner */
			char comm[64];				/* name of program executed */
		};

	- Run AVD
		emulator -avd OsPrj-5140309178 -kernel ~/kernel/goldfish/arch/arm/boot/zImage -show-kernel

	- Compile program
		- enter the file directory: cd ~/Prj1+5140309178/jni
		- use ndk-build to compile program: ndk-build
		- enter the file directory: cd ~/Prj1+5140309178/ptree
		- use make to compile program: make
		- we will get ptree.ko in ptree directory and test_ptree, StudentIDProcess, BBC in /libs/armeabi

	- Upload them into AVD
		- adb push ptree.ko /data/misc
		- adb push test_ptree /data/misc
		- adb push StudentIDProcess /data/misc
		- adb push BBC /data/misc

	- Install mod
		- insmod ptree.ko

	- Execute our program

	- Remove mod
		- rmmod ptree.ko
