CRITICAL PROCESS TO RUN PROGRAM:
	- Environment Installation
		- Install SDK
		- Setup AVD
		- Setup NDK
		- Compile a new kernel
		- Configure environment variable

	- Code Changed
		We should define struct prinfo in ~/kernel/goldfish/include/linux/prinfo.h
		This structure is defined as follows:
		struct prinfo {
			long state;								/* current state of process */
			pid_t pid;								/* process id */
			pid_t parent_pid;						/* process id of parent */
			pid_t first_child_pid; 					/* pid of youngest child */
			pid_t next_sibling_pid;  				/* pid of older sibling */
			long uid;								/* user id of process owner */
			char comm[64];							/* name of program executed */
		};

	- Run AVD
		emulator -avd OsPrj-5140309178 -kernel ~/kernel/goldfish/arch/arm/boot/zImage -show-kernel

	- Compile program
		- change the #include path in test_ptree.c and make it to the current path of prinfo.h
		- enter the file directory: cd ~/Project1/jni
		- use ndk-build to compile program: ndk-build
		- enter the file directory: cd ~/Project1/ptree
		- change the KID of Makefile and make it to the current path of kernel
		- use make to compile program: make
		- we will get ptree.ko in ptree directory and test_ptree, 5140309178Parent, BBC in /libs/armeabi

	- Upload them into AVD
		- adb push ptree.ko /data/misc
		- adb push test_ptree /data/misc
		- adb push 5140309178Parent /data/misc
		- adb push BBC /data/misc

	- Install mod
		- insmod ptree.ko

	- Execute our program

	- Remove mod
		- rmmod ptree.ko


TEST ENVIRONMENT:
	- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
	- Android kernel version(cat version)
		Linux version 3.4.67-gcf73cb7-dirty (wangbo@ubuntu) (gcc version 4.9 20150123 (prerelease) (GCC) ) #2
