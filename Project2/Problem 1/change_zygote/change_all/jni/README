Change All Descendants of Zygote:
	-change.c 					| This program is used to change the scheduling policy and priority of a
								  specific process as well as all the descendants of ong process.

								| To implement the function that changing all the descendants of a specific
								  process, I use 'ptree' system call I have written in the first project.

								| Note that the output of 'ptree' system call has been changed, I have added 
								  three columns which respectively represents the scheduling policy, priority
								  and real-time priority of a process.

								| This program has no parameters.

								| But in the execution you will be asked to enter 4 parameters.

								| 1. Whether you change a specific process and all the descendants of a process.

								| 2. The second parameter is the pid of the process you want, you can find the 
									 pid of process through 'ps' command or 'ps -P' command.

								| 3. The third parameter is the scheduling policy. 0 means SCHED_NORMAL, 1 
								     means SCHED_FIFO and 2 means SCHED_RR.

								| 4. The fourth parameter is the priority of the process, be sure to restrict 
									 your priority within a logical range.
